Not an easy feat, but personally managed to take out all enemies in the mission apart from the ones up north near the docks. For the tricky parts, remember that throwing enemies is another weapon in your arsenal, especially useful for the two Ponchos near the disguise.\\n\\nAlso remember that you can lure Long Coats with footprints, which Ponchos ignore. Very useful for taking out the Long Coat guarding the back door.\\n\\nWith a combination of the two above tips, it even managed to take out every single enemy, using only Hector, on Hard (see screenshot.

Don\'t use the bank\'s backdoor","__description":"Use the front door, 4Head.\\n\\nIt\'s the large complex near the western edge of the map, and the front door is guarded by a Poncho and located on a large open street, meaning you need to take out a lot of enemies to even get a shot at the guy guarding the door. To make it easier, there is a building facade around the back that you can drop to kill 2-3 enemies (2 from natural patrol patterns, a 3rd if you make good use of Hector\'s money).

Kill 3 guards using dogs.","__description":"It might say \\"dogs\\", but to my experience there is only a single dog, in the first area after finding the letter. So you want to mind control it 3 times to kill 3 guards. This means, at least on higher difficulties, you gotta save every mind control for the dog. Also the dog needs to survive each kill.\\nLuckily, as always with \\"kill\\" badges, you can simply kill tied up guards.
